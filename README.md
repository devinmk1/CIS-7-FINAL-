# Description
In this program you were selected to participate in the Doctors without Borders, you will first input your preffered
language, input your medical specialization, and the be assigned to a random country that needs you.

# Approach
In this program we approached it in a way that the user has already been selected and registered with the Doctors
without Borders program and that they will use this program to find the country they will be randomly assigned to
based on their preffered language and medical specialization. When programming this we decided to make use of
functions to make int main() feel less cluttered. We decided choosing the user's preffered language and medical
specialization should be in two different fucntions apart from int main(). 

# Simple Instructions
When choosing your preffered language and medical specialization, type the number that correspondes to the choice and press Enter when done.
For Example, type '1' for English then press Enter and type '4' for Internal Medicine and press Enter.
